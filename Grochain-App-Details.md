## The Problem: Nigeria's Food Insecurity Crisis

### Current Challenges

Nigeria faces significant food security challenges that threaten the nation's stability and economic growth:

1. **Supply Chain Fragmentation**: Traditional agricultural supply chains are fragmented, with multiple intermediaries reducing farmer profits by 40-60%
2. **Lack of Transparency**: Consumers cannot verify product authenticity, leading to food safety concerns
3. **Limited Market Access**: Smallholder farmers (80% of Nigeria's farmers) lack direct market access
4. **Financial Exclusion**: 70% of farmers lack access to formal credit, limiting productivity
5. **Post-Harvest Losses**: 40% of agricultural produce is lost due to poor storage and transportation
6. **Price Volatility**: Farmers receive only 20-30% of final consumer prices

### Economic Impact

- **Food Import Dependency**: Nigeria imports $10+ billion worth of food annually
- **Rural Poverty**: 70% of Nigeria's poor live in rural areas, primarily dependent on agriculture
- **Youth Migration**: 60% of rural youth migrate to cities due to limited agricultural opportunities
- **GDP Impact**: Agriculture contributes only 25% to GDP despite employing 70% of the population
