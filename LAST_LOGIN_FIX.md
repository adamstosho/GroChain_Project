# Last Login "Never" Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
The admin users page was showing "Never" for all users' last login timestamps.

## Root Cause
The `User` model was missing the `lastLogin` field, and the login controller was not updating any login timestamp.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Added `lastLogin` Field to User Model
**File**: `backend/models/user.model.js`

Added the `lastLogin` field to track when users last logged in:
```javascript
lastLogin: { type: Date },
```

Also added an index for faster queries:
```javascript
UserSchema.index({ lastLogin: -1 })
```

### 2. Update Login Timestamp on Login
**File**: `backend/controllers/auth.controller.js`

Modified the login controller to update the `lastLogin` timestamp every time a user logs in:
```javascript
// Update lastLogin timestamp and lastActive in stats
user.lastLogin = new Date()
user.stats = user.stats || {}
user.stats.lastActive = new Date()
await user.save()
```

## What This Fixes

### Before:
- ❌ All users showed "Never" for last login
- ❌ No way to track user activity
- ❌ Admin dashboard couldn't identify inactive users

### After:
- ✅ Last login is tracked for every login
- ✅ Shows actual date/time of last login
- ✅ Admin can see which users are active/inactive
- ✅ `lastActive` in stats also updated for activity tracking

## How It Works

1. User logs in via `/api/auth/login`
2. Login controller updates `user.lastLogin = new Date()`
3. Also updates `user.stats.lastActive = new Date()` for activity tracking
4. Saves the user document
5. Admin dashboard fetches users with their `lastLogin` timestamps
6. Frontend displays the date/time or "Never" if null

## Testing

### To Test:
1. **Log in** to the application
2. **Check** the admin users page at `/dashboard/users`
3. **Verify** that the logged-in user's "Last Login" shows today's date
4. **Check** other users should show their last login date or "Never" if they haven't logged in yet

### Expected Result:
- Users who have logged in will show their last login date
- Users who haven't logged in since the fix will show "Never"
- After logging in, the timestamp should update immediately

## Future Logins

Going forward, every time any user logs in:
- Their `lastLogin` timestamp is updated
- Their `stats.lastActive` is updated
- This information is available in the admin dashboard

## Additional Benefits

This fix also enables:
- Tracking user engagement and activity
- Identifying inactive users
- Generating activity reports
- Better user management insights
